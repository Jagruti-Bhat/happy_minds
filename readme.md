Mental health issues are a growing concern worldwide,
affecting individuals of all ages, genders, and socioeconomic backgrounds.
Despite advancements in mental health care and awareness, there is still a significant gap
in access to and availability of mental health resources. Many individuals face barriers such as
social stigma, lack of knowledge, financial constraints, and limited access to mental health professionals,
which prevent them from seeking help. As a result, untreated mental health conditions lead to a range of
negative outcomes, including decreased quality of life, impaired productivity, and even suicide.
To overcome this problem we have created a web app which tries to solve this by following features.

- Self assesment tool
- Mood tracking and journalling
- happiness community
- Fixing Sleep Cycles
- Educational Resources
- Scheduling Therapy session
